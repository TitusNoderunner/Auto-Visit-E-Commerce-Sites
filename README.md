**Answer:**
Chrome just got a major upgrade! When your extension shows "Restricted," it's not collecting data

This script will make your browser visit automatically whitelisted websites in order to gather data, meaning more points!

**
Explanation**

Page Load: When a page loads, the DOMContentLoaded event fires.
URL Check: The autoClickButton function is called. It first checks if the current URL is https://dashboard.3dos.io/home/dashboard.
Button Check: If the URL matches, the function proceeds to find the button using the complex selector.
Button Click: If the button is found and is not disabled, the button.click() method is called, simulating a user click.
Navigation: The rest of the script continues to work as before, navigating through the list of e-commerce sites.

**Key Improvements**

Targeted URL: The script now only attempts to click the button on the specified URL.
Button Presence: The script now checks if the button is present before attempting to click it.
Disabled Check: The script now checks if the button is disabled before clicking it, preventing errors.
Correct Event: The script uses the DOMContentLoaded event, which is the correct event to use for this purpose.
Escaped characters: The script now has escaped characters in the selector.

**How to Use**

Copy the entire script.
Open Tampermonkey (or your userscript manager).
Create a new script.
Paste the script into the editor.
Save the script.
Now, the script will only attempt to click the button when you are on https://dashboard.3dos.io/home/dashboard, and only if the button is present and active. The script will also continue to navigate through the e-commerce sites as before. Please, let me know if it works.
